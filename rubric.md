# Rubric

## Project Workflow
Progressing/Performing - There's only a marginal readme with a bit of pseudocode.  There is a whole bunch of pseudocode in your script files. I would recommend consolidating them so you have a point of reference.

## Technical Requirements
Progressing/Performing - I think you're a lot closer than you think you are. Getting the computer sequences to work is half the battle and you're most of the way there for that. Read the comments for suggestions on how to progress into the next part. Also I encourage you to look at some other class mate solutions or the one James provided.

## Code Quality
Performing - Code is properly indented. There's good comments. There's also a lot of commentted out stuff, make sure you take that out when you take this to production.

## Creativity Interface
Performing - The styles compliment each other nicely. There is an issue with the start button alignment. And lack of player functionality makes it difficult to judge the interface.

## Overall
I think you had accomplished a lot more than you had originally led on. I encourage you to keep working on this application and get it to a place you'll be proud to show potential employers. Based on the code you've written, there doesn't seem to be a fundamental misunderstanding of the concepts covered in class. That said, this project prompt was certainly one of the more difficult ones. I have no doubts that you can finish this project up before the course ends and I encourage you to do so.
