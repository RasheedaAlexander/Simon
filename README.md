Have a program choose a sequence of different colors at random and then prompt the player repeat the sequence allowing them to go to advance to next round if the player is successful.

Whenever a player clicks on a tile, there are three possible outcomes
//   // 1.) User clicked the right tile, but is yet to complete the pattern
//   // 2.) User clicked the right tile, and it was also the last tile in the pattern
//   // 3.) User clicked on the wrong tile, and the game ends
