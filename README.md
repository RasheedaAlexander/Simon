# Description
Have a program choose a sequence of different colors at random and then prompt the player repeat the sequence allowing them to go to advance to next round if the player is successful.

Whenever a player clicks on a tile, there are two possible outcomes:
 1. User clicks the correct tile and moves onto the next round
 2. User clicks on the wrong tile, and the game ends

#Stack

User clicks need to be captured.
